# Nexus
The word /nexus/ comes from latin meaning "a binding together".

This configuration aims to be exactly that: A binding between all aspects of work, creativity, and exploration, unified within emacs.

## Description
Inspired by refined configs such as [nano](https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs.git) and [doom](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs.git), Nexus aims to create an elegant and ergonomic experience; One that promotes a cohesive enviornment rather than a collection of tools.

Emacs does not need to simply be an editor.

It can describe how one interacts with a machine.

It can be the *Nexus* between the user and the system itself.
